es shell (es) 一个函数式编程的rc兼容shell，编写于二十世纪九十年代中期

rc is the command line interpreter for Version 10 Unix and Plan 9 
from Bell Labs operating systems. 
It resembles the Bourne shell, 
but its syntax is somewhat simpler. 

It was created by Tom Duff, 
who is better known for an unusual C programming language construct ("Duff's device").

A port of the original rc to Unix is part of Plan 9 from User Space. 
A rewrite of rc for Unix-like operating systems 
by Byron Rakitzis is also available but includes some incompatible changes.

Rc uses C-like control structures instead of ALGOL-like, 
as the original Bourne shell, 
except that it uses an if not construct instead of else and 
has a Bourne-like for loop to iterate over lists. 

In rc all variables are lists of strings, 
which eliminates the need for constructs like "$@".
