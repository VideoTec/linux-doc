#include <pthread.h>

int pthread_cond_init(pthread_cond_t *cond, const pthread_condattr_t *attr);
int pthread_cond_destroy(pthread_cond_t *cond);
pthread_cond_t cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;

The function pthread_cond_init() initialises the condition variable 
referenced by cond with attributes referenced by attr. 
If attr is NULL, the default condition variable attributes are used; 
the effect is the same as passing the address of a default condition variable attributes object. 
Upon successful initialisation, the state of the condition variable becomes initialised.

Attempting to initialise an already initialised condition variable results in undefined behaviour.
