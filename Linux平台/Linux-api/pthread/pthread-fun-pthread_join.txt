#include <pthread.h>

int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);

The pthread_join() function 
suspends execution of the calling thread until the target thread terminates, 
unless the target thread has already terminated. 

On return from a successful pthread_join() call with a non-NULL value_ptr argument, 
the value passed to pthread_exit() by the terminating thread 
is made available in the location referenced by value_ptr. 

When a pthread_join() returns successfully, the target thread has been terminated. 
The results of multiple simultaneous calls to pthread_join() specifying the same target thread are undefined. 
If the thread calling pthread_join() is canceled, then the target thread will not be detached.

It is unspecified whether a thread that has exited but remains unjoined counts against _POSIX_THREAD_THREADS_MAX.
