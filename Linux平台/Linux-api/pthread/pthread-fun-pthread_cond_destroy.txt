int pthread_cond_init(pthread_cond_t *cond, const pthread_condattr_t *attr);
int pthread_cond_destroy(pthread_cond_t *cond);
pthread_cond_t cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;

The function pthread_cond_destroy() destroys the given condition variable specified by cond; 
the object becomes, in effect, uninitialised. 
An implementation may cause pthread_cond_destroy() 
to set the object referenced by cond to an invalid value. 
A destroyed condition variable object can be re-initialised using pthread_cond_init(); 
the results of otherwise referencing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.

It is safe to destroy an initialised condition variable upon which no threads are currently blocked. 
Attempting to destroy a condition variable upon 
which other threads are currently blocked results in undefined behaviour
