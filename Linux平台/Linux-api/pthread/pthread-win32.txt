In general:
	pthread[VG]{SE,CE,C}[c].dll
	pthread[VG]{SE,CE,C}[c].lib

where:
	[VG] indicates the compiler
	V	- MS VC, or
	G	- GNU C

	{SE,CE,C} indicates the exception handling scheme
	SE	- Structured EH, or
	CE	- C++ EH, or
	C	- no exceptions - uses setjmp/longjmp

	c	- DLL compatibility number indicating ABI and API
		  compatibility with applications built against
		  a snapshot with the same compatibility number.
		  See 'Version numbering' below.

The name may also be suffixed by a 'd' to indicate a debugging version
of the library. E.g. pthreadVC2d.lib. Debugging versions contain
additional information for debugging (symbols etc) and are often not
optimised in any way (compiled with optimisation turned off).

Examples:
	pthreadVSE.dll	(MSVC/SEH)
	pthreadGCE.dll	(GNUC/C++ EH)
	pthreadGC.dll	(GNUC/not dependent on exceptions)
	pthreadVC1.dll	(MSVC/not dependent on exceptions - not binary
			compatible with pthreadVC.dll)
	pthreadVC2.dll	(MSVC/not dependent on exceptions - not binary
			compatible with pthreadVC1.dll or pthreadVC.dll)

The GNU library archive file names have correspondingly changed to:

	libpthreadGCEc.a
	libpthreadGCc.a
