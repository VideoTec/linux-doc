http://www.december.com/unix/ref/chmod.html
The three digits of the chmod code set permissions for these groups in this order:

Owner (you)
Group (a group of other users that you set up)
World (anyone else browsing around on the file system)

0 = no permissions whatsoever; this person cannot read, write, or execute the file
1 = execute only
2 = write only
3 = write and execute (1+2)
4 = read only
5 = read and execute (4+1)
6 = read and write (4+2)
7 = read and write and execute (4+2+1)

chmod 700 apple.txt	Only you can read, write to, or execute apple.txt
chmod 777 apple.txt	Everybody can read, write to, or execute apple.txt
chmod 744 apple.txt	Only you can read, write to, or execute apple.txt Everybody can read apple.txt;
chmod 444 apple.txt	You can only read apple.txt, as everyone else.

Not all phones and versions of android have things mounted the same.
Limiting option when remounting would be best.

Simply change ro to rw and add the remount option

# mount -o rw,remount /system
Once you are done making changes, you should remount with the original readonly.

# mount -o ro,remount /system
