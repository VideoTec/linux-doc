#include <pthread.h>

int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
int pthread_mutex_trylock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

The function pthread_mutex_trylock() 
is identical to pthread_mutex_lock() 
except that if the mutex object referenced by mutex is currently locked 
(by any thread, including the current thread), the call returns immediately.
