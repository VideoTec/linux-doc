Depending on what you want the file to contain:

1）touch /path/to/file for an empty file

2）somecommand > /path/to/file for a file containing the output of some command.

  eg: grep --help > randomtext.txt
      echo "This is some text" > randomtext.txt

3）nano /path/to/file or vi /path/to/file (or any other editor emacs,gedit etc)
It either opens the existing one 
for editing or creates & opens the empty file to enter, 
if it doesn't exist
