Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell, 
a complete implementation of 
the IEEE POSIX and Open Group shell specification with 
1）interactive command line editing, 
2）job control on architectures that support it,
 
csh-like features such as 
1）history substitution and brace 
2）expansion, and 
3）a slew of other features. 

Here is a short list of some of the features available in bash.

For more information on the features of Bash 
that are new to this type of shell, see the reference manual. 
There is also a large Unix-style man page. 
The man page is the definitive description of the shell's features.

Bash is free software, 
distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3.
