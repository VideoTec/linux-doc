In cases where default condition variable attributes are appropriate, 
the macro PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER 
can be used to initialise condition variables that are statically allocated. 

The effect is equivalent to dynamic initialisation 
by a call to pthread_cond_init() with parameter attr specified as NULL, 
except that no error checks are performed.
