pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

In cases where default mutex attributes are appropriate, 
the macro PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER can be used to initialise mutexes that are statically allocated. 
The effect is equivalent to dynamic initialisation 
by a call to pthread_mutex_init() with parameter attr specified as NULL, 
except that no error checks are performed.
